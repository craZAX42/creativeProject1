    <p>I think that birds are beautiful beings. Their majestic wings allow them
      to soar high through the heavens. All of their unique builds serve different
      purposes. For example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WigEGNnuTE">
        owl</a> has a silent flight while the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7rOjh4Lr78">
          falcon</a> has the fastest descent.

    <p>However, there are many birds that are going extinct. Some causes are
      deforestation and the natural food chain of the wild. I think it's important
      that we preserve these endangered species of birds. It's not just about
      the sorrow that comes with dying species and wildlife. It's more so about
      the things we can learn from these species that may help us improve our
      understanding of the world and aid in our implementation and improvement of
      technology.
