    <img src="../photos/Giant-ibis.jpg">
    <p>Far more majestic than its smaller, garbage-diving relatives, the giant
      ibis (Thaumatibis gigantea) has been declared the most endangered and
      evolutionarily distinctive bird in the world. Native to the marshes, wide
      rivers, and seasonal water meadows of northern Cambodia, with a few individuals
      hiding out in southern Laos and perhaps Vietnam, these are some huge birds.
      They stand around a metre tall and weigh over 4 kg, and carry a dusty brown
      hue across their plumage and exposed skin. Next to nothing is known about
      their breeding habits, and it’s estimated that just over 100 breeding pairs
      are left in the wild. Relentless deforestation, droughts, and hunting have
      together contributed to this species’ rapid decline.
