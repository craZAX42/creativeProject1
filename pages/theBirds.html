    <p>These birds are the most likely to become extinct in the coming years.
      We have a duty to learn about these creatures and help them strive in
      this world. I hope that together we will be able to overcome this
      epidemic of extinction.

    <h3 id="giant-ibis">Giant Ibis</h3>
    <img src="../photos/Giant-ibis.jpg">
    <p>Far more majestic than its smaller, garbage-diving relatives, the giant
      ibis (Thaumatibis gigantea) has been declared the most endangered and
      evolutionarily distinctive bird in the world. Native to the marshes, wide
      rivers, and seasonal water meadows of northern Cambodia, with a few individuals
      hiding out in southern Laos and perhaps Vietnam, these are some huge birds.
      They stand around a metre tall and weigh over 4 kg, and carry a dusty brown
      hue across their plumage and exposed skin. Next to nothing is known about
      their breeding habits, and it’s estimated that just over 100 breeding pairs
      are left in the wild. Relentless deforestation, droughts, and hunting have
      together contributed to this species’ rapid decline.

    <h3 id="new-caliedonion">New Caledonion Owlet-Nightjar</h3>
    <img src="../photos/australianowletnightjar.jpg">
    <p>By far the most elusive species of bird in the world, the New Caledonian
      owlet-nightjar (Aegotheles savesi) has not been seen alive since 1998.
      The species is found only in the humid forests of New Caledonia -
      a little archipelago 1,210 km to the east of Australia - and is known from
       just two preserved specimens. One of these was the first New Caledonian
       owlet-nightjar ever found, and was identified when it flew into someone’s
       window in 1880. The other specimen is dated to 1915. A couple of expeditions
       to New Caledonia in 2002 and 2007 failed to produce a single sighting.
       It's thought there are between 1 and 49 adults left in the wild.

    <h3 id="california-condor">California Condor</h3>
    <img src="../photos/california-condor.jpg">
    <p>If you're caught one too many times knee-deep in the carrion you're currently
      enjoying as your lunch, you're pretty much guaranteed to find yourself the
      subject of some kind of horrific mythology. The Native American tribes of
      California held several beliefs about the California condor, none more
      literally blood-soaked than that of the Mono people of the central Sierra
      Nevada Mountains, the Eastern Sierra, and the Mono Basin. According to legend,
      the California condor would seize humans, cut off their heads, and drain
      their blood in order to flood the home of a figure known simply as the
      Ground Squirrel. The Condor would grab the Ground Squirrel as he fled from
      his burrow, but as he lowered his head to drink his victim's blood,
      the Ground Squirrel would cut off the Condor's head. It was also believed
      that by wearing their feathers, the 'money finders' of the Mono tribe could
      inherit the California condor's keen eyesight to help them seek out lost valuables.
      Nowadays, the California condor's decline has been pinned to its low output
      of offspring, poaching, lead poisoning, and habitat destruction. According
      to a study published in 2012, the leading cause of mortality in young
      condors is eating trash fed to them by their parents.

    <p>I could tell you about the gorgeous and endangered kakapo (Strigops habroptilus)

      more charming job of it

    <h3 id="kagu">Kagu</h3>
    <img src="../photos/kagu.jpg">
    <p>Something tells me, just by looking at it, that this incredibly elegant
      bird wouldn't be caught dead ripping people's heads off or trying to mate
      with them. Known locally in its native New Caledonia as 'the ghost of the
      forest', the ash-white, almost flightless kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) is the
      only living representative of the entire Rhynochetidae clade. While the largest
      island of the New Caledonian archipelago, Grand Terre, has adopted the heron-like
      bird as its national emblem, that hasn't stopped its introduced dogs, cats,
      and pigs from relentlessly picking them off. Habitat loss has also led to
       the species' steep decline over the last 20 years.

    <h3 id="bengal-florican">Bengal Florican</h3>
    <img src="../photos/bengal-florican.jpg">
    <p>Bengal florican (Houbaropsis bengalensis) can also be found thousands of
      kilometres away in a second tiny population along the base of the Himalayas.
      It's thought that there are currently fewer than 1,000 adults left in the wild,
      so the Cambodian government has established six Bengal Florican Conservation Areas
      in order to protect 173 square kilometres of breeding habitat in the grasslands
     and 138 square kilometres of open forest. They've also been working on
     awareness programs for local communities, which will hopefully see a reduction
     in poaching. A number of farmers living close to the conservation areas
     have joined a wildlife-friendly farming scheme as part of the program.

    <h3 id="forest-owlet">Forest Owlet</h3>
    <img src="../photos/forest-owlet.jpg">
    <p>Don't be fooled - this stocky little bird might look docile, but you wouldn't
      want to get in its way when it's hungry. The forest owlet (Heteroglaux blewitti)
       wields ridiculously huge talons, which it uses to snare prey animals up to twice its own size.
       The critically endangered species has been reduced to a tiny, fragmented population
       in central India, which remains threatened by the ongoing loss of deciduous
       forest in the area. For over a century, the species was assumed to be extinct,
       until it was rediscovered in 1997 in Maharashtra by American ornithologist, Pamela Rasmussen.
       The population is estimated at between 70 and 400 individuals.

    <h3 id="philippine-eagle">Philippine Eagle</h3>
    <img src="../photos/Philippine-Eagle.jpg">
    <p>With its shaggy bronze mane and proud white chest, the Philippine eagle
      (Pithecophaga jefferyi) is about as magestic as a bird can get. Capable of
      growing to more than a metre long and 8 kg in weight, this stunning creature
      is the largest eagle in the world, in terms of length. Found only in the Philippines,
       it was was originally named the 'monkey-eating eagle', thanks to an assumption
       that it preyed exclusively on primates. Later studies confirmed that monkeys,
       and pretty much everything else was fair game, from civets and hornbills to
       large snakes and monitor lizards. One of the big hurdles in conserving the
       Philippine eagle is that each breeding pair requires a range up to 40 square
       kilometres to adequately feed and rear their offspring, which makes it particularly
       vulnerable to deforestation. It's thought that the wild population currently
       stands at around 180 to 500 mature adults.

    <h3 id="christmas-island">Christmas Island FrigateBird</h3>
    <img src="../photos/Christmas-island-frigatebird.jpg">
    <p>Maybe I've been playing too much Dark Souls, but if someone approached me
      with a swollen skin-balloon anchored to their throat and chest area, my
      first move would be to reach for my Havel and Antiquated armour sets and
      brace myself for a heavy bout of cursing cloud. But I'm clearly not a frigatebird,
       so what would I know. Also, ladies, the Christmas Island frigatebird (Fregata andrewsi)
        can do other things besides very conspicuous self-inflation. It happens to belong to
        the Fregatidae family of birds that boast the largest wingspan to body weight
        ratio in the world, which means it can stay happily aloft for more than a week
       at a time without rest. It's also pretty great at performing kleptoparasitism,
        which means stealing food from other birds, so that's something. This critically
         endangered native Australian species is currently sitting at an estimate of 2400
          to 4800 adults left in the wild.

    <h3 id="ground-cuckoo">Sumatran Ground-Cuckoo</h3>
    <img src="../photos/sumatran-ground-cuckoo.jpg">
    <p>This striking little forest-dweller hails from the thick, humid rainforests
      of southern Sumatra. It keeps to the forest floor, where its dull green, brown,
       and black plumage works as fantastic camouflage, unlike the bright ring of
       turquoise, blue and magenta that orbits its eyes. It's known from just eight specimens,
        and it's thought that there are just 70 to 400 individuals left in the wild.
        In 2007, its call was recorded for the first time, its song resembling something
         of an awkward "double squark".
